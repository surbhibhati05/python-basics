        "1.What is python, and why it is popular?\n",
        "  - Python is a programming language which is eazy to learn, versatile and can be used for many different applications. which makes it popular among developers and programmers.\n",
        "  - It is compatible with various programming paradigms, such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",
        "  - It has a large and active community of developers, an extensive standard library, and third-party packages for various domains.\n",
        "  - It is efficient,versatile, has large community, has rich ecosystem and can run on many platforms.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "  - Its a programme that reads and execute python code. It translates Python code into bytecode, which is a lower-level representation of the code that the Python Virtual Machine can execute.\n",
        "  - Programmers can use the interpreter to test and run code line by line\n",
        "  - The interpreter can be used in interactive mode, where it prompts for the next command.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "   - Pre-defined Keywords are the words that hold a special meaning and have specific purpose, these are reserved words in Python that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.).\n",
        "   - Examples of keywords include if, else, while, for, def, class, import,try, except, return, True, False, None, etc.\n",
        "   - Keywords are case-sensitive and cannot be redefined or overridden\n",
        "   within a Python program.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4.Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "   - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names as Keywords are reserved\n",
        "   words.\n",
        "   - Variable names are symbolic names associated with an abstract\n",
        "  storage location.\n",
        "   - They are used to store value or the variable itself.\n",
        "   Variable names must start with a letter or underscore, and can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores.\n",
        "\n",
        " 5.What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "   - mutability is the ability of objects to change their values. Object whose state or value can be changed after they are created are called as mutable objects.\n",
        "\n",
        " 6.Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "   - Lists can be modified or changed after they are created that's why they are mutable.The elements of a list can be added or removed or modified without creating a new files\n",
        "   - Tuples as list can not be changed that's why they are immutable.Tuples are not modifiable in nature.\n",
        "\n",
        " 7.What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "   - “==” compares the value of two objects. For eg: “==” would return true if the values of two objects are same.\n",
        "   - “is” compares the identites of two objects. For eg: “is” would return true if two variables point to the same objects.\n",
        "\n",
        " 8.What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "   - Logical operators are:- \"and\",\"or\",and \"not\".\n",
        "   - \"and\":- Returns True if both operands are true. For eg: x < 5 and x < 10.\n",
        "   - \"or\":- Returns True if atleast one operand is true. For eg: x < 5 or x < 4.\n",
        "   - \"not\":- Returns the inverse the boolean value of the operand. For eg:\n",
        "   not (x < 5 and x < 10)\n",
        "\n",
        " 9.What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "   - The process of changing the data type of a value/objects.\n",
        "   - Python provides built-in functions for type casting, such as int(), float(), str(), list(), tuple(), dict(), etc.\n",
        "   - Type casting is often necessary for performing arithmetic operations, data manipulation, and input/output operations in Python programs.\n",
        "\n",
        " 10.What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "   - Implicit Type Casting:- It is automatic, the compiler or interpreter automatically changes the data type of a value. Used when converting smaller data types to larger data types, or when performing operations on values of different types.  \n",
        "   - Explicit Type Casting:- It is manual,the programmer manually changes the data type of a value. Used when the programmer needs to ensure that a value is of a certain type, or when information might be lost in the conversion.\n",
        "\n",
        " 11.What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "    - Conditionals in Python are used to execute code based on the evaluation of one or more conditions.They help you to code deciosions based on some pre-conditions.\n",
        "    - Python supports conditional statements such as if, elif (else if), and else to control the flow of execution.\n",
        "    - Conditionals can be nested to handle multiple conditions and control different branches of execution based on the outcome of logical expressions.\n",
        "\n",
        " 12.How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "     - \"elif\" stands for \"else if\". It can be used in conditional statements to check for multiple conditions.\n",
        "     - For example:-if the first condition is false, it moves on to the next “elif” statement to check if that condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        " 13.What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "     - \"for loop\":- Used to iterate over a sequence of elements.\n",
        "        > The keyword used in this control flow statement is \"for\".\n",
        "        > When the number of iterations is already known, the for loop is\n",
        "         used.\n",
        "     - \"while loop\":- It repeatedly execute a block of code until a\n",
        "        specified condition become False.\n",
        "        > This loop is represented by the keyword \"while\".\n",
        "        > When the number of iterations is unknown, a while loop is used. The statement is repeated until the Boolean value is false.\n",
        "\n",
        "   14.Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.   \n",
        "     - A while loop is more suitable than a for loop when you don't know the exact number of iterations in advance, and the loop should continue running until a specific condition is met.\n",
        "     - For example, consider a situation where you're reading input from a user until they provide valid data. You don't know beforehand how many times the user will need to be prompted, so a while loop is a good fit.\n",
        "\n",
        "      ## Asking the user for a valid input\n",
        "       user_input = \"\"\n",
        "       while user_input != \"yes\" and user_input != \"no\":\n",
        "       user_input = input(\"Please type 'yes' or 'no': \")\n",
        "       print(\"You entered:\", user_input)\n",
        "\n",
        "     - In this case, the loop will keep asking the user for input until they type either \"yes\" or \"no\". Since you don't know how many attempts the user will need, a while loop is more appropriate than a for loop, which typically requires knowing the number of iterations in advance.\n",
